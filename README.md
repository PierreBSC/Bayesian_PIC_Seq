# Bayesian PIC-Seq

This repository contains a set of Stan-based scripts allowing to analyze PIC-seq (Physically Interacting Cell - Sequencing) data. Those scripts have been tested on the data from the Nature Biotech paper "Dissecting cellular crosstalk by sequencing physically interacting cells".

Briefly this PIC-seq processing script take as an input the gene expression profile of PIC/doublets together with the mean expression profiled of each single-cell cluster.
